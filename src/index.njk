<p>Understanding ai basics</p>
<p>AI refers to technologies that can understand, learn, and act based on acquired and derived information. Today, AI works in three ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Assisted intelligence, widely available today, improves what people and organizations are already doing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Augmented intelligence, emerging today, enables people and organizations to do things they couldn&rsquo;t otherwise do.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Autonomous intelligence, being developed for the future, features machines that act on their own. An example of this will be self-driving vehicles, when they come into widespread use.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>AI can be said to possess&nbsp;<a href="https://www.balbix.com/resources/executive-guide-to-ai-and-machine-learning/">some degree of human intelligence</a>: a store of domain-specific knowledge; mechanisms to acquire new knowledge; and mechanisms to put that knowledge to use. Machine learning, expert systems, neural networks, and deep learning are all examples or subsets of AI technology today.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Machine learning&nbsp;uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to &ldquo;learn&rdquo; (e.g., progressively improve performance) using data rather than being explicitly programmed. Machine learning works best when aimed at a specific task rather than a wide-ranging mission.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Expert systems&nbsp;are programs designed to solve problems within specialized domains. By mimicking the thinking of human experts, they solve problems and make decisions using fuzzy rules-based reasoning through carefully curated bodies of knowledge.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Neural networks&nbsp;use a biologically-inspired programming paradigm which enables a computer to learn from observational data. In a neural network, each node assigns a weight to its input representing how correct or incorrect it is relative to the operation being performed. The final output is then determined by the sum of such weights.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Deep learning&nbsp;is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Today, image recognition via deep learning is often better than humans, with a variety of applications such as autonomous vehicles, scan analyses, and medical diagnoses.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<p>Medical industry:</p>
<p>Advances in computational power paired with massive amounts of data generated in healthcare systems make many clinical problems ripe for AI applications. Below are two recent applications of accurate and clinically relevant algorithms that can benefit both patients and doctors by making diagnosis more straightforward.</p>
<p>The first of these algorithms is one of the multiple existing examples of an algorithm that outperforms doctors in image classification tasks. In the fall of 2018, researchers at Seoul National University Hospital and College of Medicine developed an AI algorithm called&nbsp;<a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/radiol.2018180237">DLAD</a> (Deep Learning-based Automatic Detection) to analyze chest radiographs and detect abnormal cell growth, such as potential cancers (Figure 2). The algorithm&rsquo;s performance was compared to multiple physicians&rsquo; detection abilities on the same images and outperformed 17 of 18 doctors.</p>
<p>The second of these algorithms comes from researchers at Google AI Healthcare, also in the fall of 2018, who created a learning algorithm,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/10.5858/arpa.2018-0147-OA">LYNA</a> (Lymph Node Assistant), that analyzed histology slides&nbsp;<a href="http://mhpl.facilities.northwestern.edu/files/2013/10/The-Science-and-Application-of-Hematoxylin-and-Eosin-Staining-6-5-2012.pdf">stained tissue samples</a>) to identify metastatic breast cancer tumors from lymph node biopsies. This isn&rsquo;t the first application of AI to attempt histology analysis, but interestingly this algorithm could identify suspicious regions undistinguishable to the human eye in the biopsy samples given. LYNA was tested on two datasets and was shown to accurately classify a sample as cancerous or noncancerous correctly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30295070">99%</a> of the time. Furthermore, when given to doctors to use in conjunction with their typical analysis of stained tissue samples, LYNA halved the average slide review time.</p>
<p>Recently,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ejcancer.com/article/S0959-8049(19)30221-7/fulltext?mc_cid=836d2af55c&mc_eid=5f18dc3d9e#/article/S0959-8049(19)30221-7/fulltext">other</a> imaging-based algorithms showed a similar ability to increase physician accuracy. In the short term, these algorithms can be used by doctors to assist with double-checking their diagnoses and interpreting patient data faster without sacrificing accuracy. In the long term, however, government approved algorithms could function independently in the clinic, allowing doctors to focus on cases that computers cannot solve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cybersecurity:</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is one of those categories that can be categorized as one of the hardest problems for us to solve, that is where AI comes in. With the constant evolution of cyber attacks and proliferation of devices, machine learning and AI can be used to keep up with hackers/scammers etc, automating threat detection and respond more effectively than traditional softwares.</p>
<p>A self-learning, AI-based cyber security management system should have the ability to solve all major problems in the field of cybersecurity, for example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>dealing with hundreds of attack vectors</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>A vast attack surface</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Shortage in skilled security professionals</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Technologies exist that can train a self-learning system continuously to gather data from various information systems (whether it be your enterprise or just your household), analyze it and use it to perform&nbsp;correlation of patterns across millions to billions of signals relevant to you; leading to a new level of intelligence designed to protect us from hackers and their malicious software:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Threat Exposure&nbsp;&ndash; hackers follow trends just like everyone else, so what&rsquo;s fashionable with hackers changes regularly. AI-based cybersecurity systems can provide up to date knowledge of global and industry specific threats to help make critical prioritization decisions based not only on what could be used to attack your enterprise, but based on what is likely to be used to attack your enterprise.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Controls Effectiveness&nbsp;&ndash; it is important to understand the impact of the various security tools and security processes that you have employed to maintain a strong security posture. AI can help understand where your infosec program has strengths, and where it has gaps.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Breach Risk Prediction&nbsp;&ndash; Accounting for IT asset inventory, threat exposure, and controls effectiveness, AI-based systems can predict how and where you are most likely to be breached, so that you can plan for resource and tool allocation towards areas of weakness. Prescriptive insights derived from AI analysis can help you configure and enhance controls and processes to most effectively improve your organization&rsquo;s cyber resilience.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Incident response&nbsp;&ndash; AI powered systems can provide improved context for prioritization and response to security alerts, for fast response to incidents, and to surface root causes in order to mitigate vulnerabilities and avoid future issues.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Job searching:</p>
<p>AI already has a massive role in job searching, such that 75% of resumes are rejected by an automated applicant tracking system (ATS) before actually reaching a human being.</p>
<p>In the past, employers have had to spend a considerable amount of time analyzing resumes and deciding on the best hire, data from LinkedIn shows that they spend around 23 hours looking for the best suited employee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, AI scanning systems have been implemented to help managers in finding the best applicant, 67% of them have said that the AI helped incredibly.</p>
<p>As time passes, AI is increasingly being used in searching for jobs and thus will be able to find the best jobs for people as well as find the best employees for business owners.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Building AI:</p>
<p>In the recent past, we required extremely skilled workers to develop simple webpages whereas nowadays we have the facility of drag and drop features to build them for us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, the same thing will happen with artificial intelligence and machine learning. We will have simple tools we can use to build our AI so we are less reliant on coding skills and can still use AI to develop more and more applications. These low-code or no-code tools will truly democratize artificial intelligence technology.</p>
<p>City building:<br>Sooner or later, AI can be used in planning the developments of cities and large infrastructures in such a way that they are more sustainable, less congested and generally more livable. The use of previous data on city construction will provide the necessary data for AI to work its magic.</p>
